 Title:  ThreatGuard AI: Intelligent Scam & Malicious Content Protection
 
Overview :ThreatGuard AI is a web-based application designed to protect users from online scams and malicious content. Leveraging the power of Google Gemini AI and built with Python (Flask), it provides a simple interface where users can upload suspicious PDF or text files for scam analysis, or input URLs to check for malicious intent (like phishing or malware). Its core aim is to offer an accessible and intelligent first line of defense against common digital threats, presenting clear detection results directly through a user-friendly web interface.

 
Aim:
To provide a user-friendly and effective tool for safeguarding individuals from various online threats, specifically focusing on scam emails and malicious website links, by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence.
